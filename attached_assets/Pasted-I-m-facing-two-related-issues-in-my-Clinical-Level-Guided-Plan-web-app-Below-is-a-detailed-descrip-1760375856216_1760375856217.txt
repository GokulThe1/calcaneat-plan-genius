I’m facing two related issues in my  Clinical-Level Guided Plan web app. Below is a detailed description of the entire flow and exactly where the problems occur:

Step-by-Step Flow:

I start on the “Book Your Consultation” page.

I see three doctors listed and, on the right side, a Booking Summary section.

I select a date, and then a row of time slots appears to choose from.

After choosing the slot, I click “Continue to Sign Up.”

I’m redirected to the Sign-Up page, where I enter my account details (name, email, phone, password, etc.).

After creating the account, I’m taken to the Character Creation page, where I either upload or select a preset character.

Next, I’m directed to the Payment page, where I enter payment details (dummy or real).

After submitting payment, I get a success message that says:
“Payment Successful – Your consultation has been booked successfully.”

Below that, there are two buttons:

“Sign in to View Profile”

“Back to Home.”

When I click “Sign in to View Profile,” I get an error:
“404 – Page Not Found.”

Issue 1 – 404 Error:

The “Sign in to View Profile” button after payment success seems to be linked to a broken or non-existent route.

Please check the redirect or navigation path for that button — it should ideally lead to an existing route like /dashboard or /profile.

Ensure that the corresponding route/component is properly created, exported, and registered in the router (for example, in App.js or router.jsx).

Also confirm that after sign-up and payment, the user authentication state persists so that the new user can actually view their profile immediately.

Issue 2 – Database Not Storing User Data:

Even though the front-end sign-up flow completes successfully, I noticed that no data is getting saved in the database — neither in development nor production.

Each time I create a new account, no dummy or real entries appear in the connected database.

Please verify:

If the backend or Firebase/Supabase connection is correctly configured.

Whether the sign-up API or database write logic (createUser or addUser function) is properly connected to the database instance.

If environment variables like DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, or MONGO_URI are missing or misconfigured.

That the database schema or collection actually exists and matches the data model used during sign-up.

The goal is to ensure that every new user account created during sign-up (even in dummy mode) generates an actual record in the database.

Summary of Fix Request:

Fix the broken redirect link for “Sign in to View Profile” (currently showing 404).

Ensure user account data is properly created and visible in the database after sign-up.

Verify that both frontend routing and backend data persistence work smoothly together across all stages of the flow.

Once fixed, I should be able to:

Successfully sign up and have my account data stored in the database.

Click “Sign in to View Profile” after payment and be redirected to the correct Profile/Dashboard page instead of seeing the 404 error.
