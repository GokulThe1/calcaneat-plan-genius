Book Consultation → Sign-Up → Auto-Login → Character Creation → Payment → Dashboard/Profile

and it’s all connected to your Neon + Drizzle database.



✅ The user is automatically logged in after sign-up (no manual login step).

✅ The character creation and payment success data are saved to the database.

✅ The redirect after payment (View Profile / Dashboard) actually loads the user’s stored data.

Here’s a ready-to-paste prompt for Replit that clearly explains all that — so it knows you’ve already built the flow and just need it to finish connecting all the moving parts properly 👇

⚙️ Prompt for Replit — Final Flow Integration with Neon + Drizzle

I’ve already implemented the complete Clinical-Level Guided Plan flow in my Calcaneat app as discussed:

Book Consultation → Select doctor, date, and time.

Sign-Up → User enters name, email, password, and phone.

After successful sign-up, the user should be automatically logged in (no need for a separate login page).

Character Creation → User uploads or selects an avatar.

Dummy Payment → Shows “Payment Successful” message.

Redirect to Dashboard/Profile → User should see the saved data (doctor, date, avatar, payment status).

🧩 What’s Already Done

I’m using Neon Database (PostgreSQL) connected through Drizzle ORM.

Connection file:

import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless';
import ws from "ws";
import * as schema from "@shared/schema";

neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error("DATABASE_URL must be set.");
}

export const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
export const db = drizzle({ client: pool, schema });


The app connects successfully (no errors).

Pages and flow are working correctly, but data is not persisting (no inserts visible in Neon dashboard).

⚠️ What Needs to Be Fixed

Auto-Login After Sign-Up

Once a new user signs up, automatically log them in and store their user_id in session or JWT.

The session should persist so they can directly continue to Character Creation.

Ensure Each Step Saves Data

On sign-up → insert user record into users table.

On character creation → update users table with avatar_url.

On payment → create a record in bookings table with doctor, date, time, and payment status “paid”.

Connect All Inserts/Updates to Neon via Drizzle

Example for sign-up:

const { data, error } = await db.insert(schema.users).values({
  name,
  email,
  phone,
  plan_type: 'Clinical',
});


Example for avatar update:

await db.update(schema.users)
  .set({ avatar_url })
  .where(eq(schema.users.id, userId));


Example for booking:

await db.insert(schema.bookings).values({
  user_id: userId,
  doctor_name,
  date,
  time_slot,
  payment_status: 'paid',
});


Fix Redirect After Payment

When “Payment Successful” message appears, the “Sign in to View Profile” button should redirect to /dashboard.

The dashboard should load real data from Neon using Drizzle:

const bookings = await db.select().from(schema.bookings)
  .where(eq(schema.bookings.user_id, userId));


Ensure no more 404 error for this route.

Test End-to-End Flow

New user signs up → record created in users table.

Character created → avatar updated in DB.

Payment completed → booking created in DB.

Dashboard displays stored details correctly.

✅ Expected Outcome

User automatically logs in after sign-up.

Each step (sign-up, character, payment) saves data correctly in Neon via Drizzle ORM.

Dashboard/Profile loads stored data with no missing or blank fields.

The entire flow runs smoothly without 404 errors or broken redirects.

Please verify that the Neon connection is active and that all database insert/update calls are properly executed at each stage of the flow.
